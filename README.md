## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm Patryk, just a guy who loves to figure out how computers really think. I started coding when I was younger because I wanted to modify games, and now I'm building full systems.

I don't like using heavy frameworks that much. I prefer to write things **from scratch** so I can understand every bit of memory my code is using. It's harder, but it teaches me way more.

## 🧠 My Philosophy

```bash
rucix@dev:~/mindset$ cat mindset.txt

# Why I do it hard way
Libs are fast but you dont know what happens inside.
To be good dev you need to know basics.

When I build from 0 I learn:
 - Memory management
 - How PCs talk
 - Binary parsing
```
